# The-Three-Switches-Puzzle
Problem Statement:
You are in a room with three light switches, labeled A, B, and C, and three light bulbs in another room, labeled 1, 2, and 3. Each switch corresponds to one bulb, but you don't know which switch controls which bulb. You can enter the room with the bulbs only once.

Your task is to determine which switch corresponds to which bulb by flipping the switches as needed. However, once you enter the room with the bulbs, you can't go back to the switch room.

Solution:
To solve this puzzle, you can follow these steps:

Turn on the first switch (A) and wait for a few minutes.
Turn off the first switch (A) and turn on the second switch (B).
Enter the room with the bulbs.
Now, observe the bulbs:

If a bulb is on, it corresponds to the second switch (B).
If a bulb is off and warm to the touch, it corresponds to the first switch (A).
If a bulb is off and cool to the touch, it corresponds to the third switch (C).
